      <h2>Distributed</h2>
      <p>This web application happens to be running on <a href="http://www.datacosmos.com">Datacomos</a>, but it can run anywhere. Even on your local machine. Download, modify, and run it however you like.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>Every Gratzi you create is stored in your DropBox, Google Drive, GitHub, or wherever you have cloud storage. They don't go anywhere else. A Gratzi is between you and the person you send it to.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>This is just the starting point. Anyone can change how Gratzi works or create new tools for it. Since no single organization owns this (see distributed and personal) it's free to evolve organically. </p>
