      <p>This application can run anywhere, even on your local machine. 
        Download, modify, and run it however you like.</p>

      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>Every Gratzi you create is stored in your DropBox, Google Drive, GitHub, or wherever you have cloud storage. 
        There is no big server somewhere storing your Gratzi.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>Anyone can change how Gratzi works or create new tools for it. 
        Since no single organization owns this (see distributed and personal) it's free to evolve organically. </p>
