      <h1>Gratitude</h1>
      <h2>wants to be free.</h2>

      <!--<h2>Gratzi are tokens of gratitude.</h2>-->
      <p>You send a Grat to your friend and he replies with a Zi.</p>
      <p>The resulting Gratzi is a two-way exchange of gratitude and acceptance between you and your friend.</p> 
      <p>Gratzi are also:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>not copied to any centralized service (distributed)</li>
        <li>sent only to the person you designate (private)</li>
        <li>encrypted (confidential)</li>
        <li>signed (authentic)</li>
        <li>generated by open-source client-side javascript (open)</li>
        <li>stored in your personal storage provider (yours)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How it works</h3>

      <p>Gratzi is an example of an <a href="http://unhosted.org">unhosted</a> application. Also known as "serverless", "client-side", or "static" web apps, unhosted web apps do not send your user data to their server. Either you connect your own server at runtime, or your data stays within the browser.</p>


      <h3>So what?</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that <strong>gratitude</strong>, if expressed consistently and meaningfully, 
        can be <strong>tremendously useful</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our hope is that by creating enough Gratzi we can:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>more directly see how and why value flows between individuals</li>
        <li>more easily identify who to help and how in order to reach a common goal.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We believe that an open standard for creating and sharing Gratzi's could help
        usher in a new wave of people-centric technologies and services. 
      </p>



      <p>And it's also much more than that...</p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>

      <p>
        To make a universal system of value exchange without middlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create the world's first viral unhosted web app.
      </p>
