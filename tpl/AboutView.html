      <!--<h2>Gratzi are tokens of gratitude.</h2>-->

      <p>
        Gratitude is a defining characteristic of our humanity. Gratitude greases the wheels of civilization. Gratitude gives
         us meaning.
      </p>

      <p>
        But gratitude is underserved in the digital world. No universal protocol exists for the expression of 
        gratitude, no common format. Myriad internet companies compete and profit from our expressions of gratitude. 
        It's difficult to collect, backup, and reuse all our scattered expressions of gratitude. If those companies disappear, 
        or change their Terms of Service, our precious digital expressions could be gone forever.
      </p>

      <p>Gratzi exists to change that.</p>

      <h3>What is GRATZi?</h3>
      <p>Gratzi is a simple way to say thank you.</p>

      <p>You send a Grat to your friend and he replies with a Zi. The resulting Gratzi is a two-way exchange of gratitude and acceptance between you and your friend.</p>

      <p>It's also more.</p>

      <p>Gratzi are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>not copied to any centralized service (distributed)</li>
        <li>sent only to the person you designate (private)</li>
        <!--<li>encrypted (confidential)</li>
        <li>signed (authentic)</li>-->
        <li>generated by open-source client-side javascript (open)</li>
        <li>stored in your personal storage provider (personal)</li>
      </ul>

      Most importantly, Gratzi are <strong>yours</strong>.

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>

      <p>
        Gratzi is an example of an <a href="http://unhosted.org">unhosted</a> application. Also known as "serverless", 
        "client-side", or "static" web apps, unhosted web apps do not send your user data to their server. 
        Either you connect your own server at runtime, or your data stays within the browser.
      </p>


      <h3>So what?</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that <strong>gratitude</strong>, if expressed consistently and meaningfully, 
        can be <strong>tremendously useful</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our hope is that by creating enough Gratzi we can:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>see how and why value flows between individuals</li>
        <li>identify who to help and how in order to reach a common goal.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We believe that an open standard for creating and sharing Gratzi could help
        usher in a new wave of people-centric technologies and services. 
      </p>


      <h3>Mission</h3>

      <p>
        To make a universal system of value exchange without middlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create the world's first viral unhosted web app.
      </p>
