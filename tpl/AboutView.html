      <h1>Gratitude</h1>
      <h2>wants to be free.</h2>

      <!--<h2>Gratzi are tokens of gratitude.</h2>-->  
      <p>We're taught gratitude when we're young. We strive to refine it with age. 
        We discover it as our greatest gift and dearest companion.</p>

      <p>Gratitude is a defining characteristic of our humanity. Gratitude greases the wheels of civilization. Gratitude gives
         us meaning.</p>
        
      <p>But gratitude is underserved in the digital world. There exists no universal protocol for the expression of 
        gratitude, no common format. Myriad internet companies compete for our expressions of gratitude and profit from them. 
        It's difficult to gather, backup, and reuse all of our scattered expressions of gratitude. If those companies disappear, 
        or change their terms of service, all those precious digital expressions could be gone forever.
      </p>
      
      <p>Gratzi exists to change that.</p>

      <h3>What is Gratzi?</h3>
      <p>Gratzi is a simple way to say thank you to the people in your life.</p>

      <p>You send a Grat to your friend and he replies with a Zi. The resulting Gratzi is a two-way exchange of gratitude and acceptance between you and your friend.</p> 

      <p>But it's also much more than that. Gratzi <strong>works</strong> differently.</p>

      <p>Gratzi are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>not copied to any centralized service (distributed)</li>
        <li>sent only to the person you designate (private)</li>
        <li>encrypted (confidential)</li>
        <li>signed (authentic)</li>
        <li>generated by open-source client-side javascript (open)</li>
        <li>stored in your personal storage provider (yours)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>

      <p>Gratzi is an example of an <a href="http://unhosted.org">unhosted</a> application. Also known as "serverless", 
        "client-side", or "static" web apps, unhosted web apps do not send your user data to their server. 
        Either you connect your own server at runtime, or your data stays within the browser.</p>


      <h3>So what?</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that <strong>gratitude</strong>, if expressed consistently and meaningfully, 
        can be <strong>tremendously useful</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our hope is that by creating enough Gratzi we can:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>see how and why value flows between individuals</li>
        <li>identify who to help and how in order to reach a common goal.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We believe that an open standard for creating and sharing Gratzi could help
        usher in a new wave of people-centric technologies and services. 
      </p>


      <h3>Mission</h3>

      <p>
        To make a universal system of value exchange without middlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create the world's first viral unhosted web app.
