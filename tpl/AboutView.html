      <h3>Gratzi are exchanges of gratitude.</h3>

      <p>You send a Grat to your friend and he sends you a Zi. Together you and your friend create a Gratzi.</p>
      <p>Gratzi's are also:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>not copied to any centralized service (distributed)</li>
        <li>sent only to the person you designate (exclusive)</li>
        <li>encrypted (confidential)</li>
        <li>signed (authentic)</li>
        <li>generated by open-source client-side javascript (open)</li>
        <li>stored in your personal storage provider (yours)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        <p>
          We believe that an open standard for creating and sharing Gratzi's could help
        usher in a new wave of people-centric technologies and services. 
        
        We are a part of the unhosted movement, where applications and data are separate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our hope is that by creating enough Gratzi we can:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>see how flows value directly, without need of a currency</li>
          <li>identify who to help and how in order to reach a common goal.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>And it's also much more than that...</p>

        Mission:
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a universal system of value exchange without middlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create the worlds first viral unhosted web app.

      <h2>Distributed</h2>
      <p>This web application is running on <a href="<%= url %>"><%= url %></a>, but it can run anywhere. Even on your local machine. Download, modify, and run it however you like.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>Every Gratzi you create is stored in your DropBox, Google Drive, GitHub, or wherever you have cloud storage. They don't go anywhere else. A Gratzi is between you and the person you send it to.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>This is just the starting point. Anyone can change how Gratzi works or create new tools for it. Since no single organization owns this (see distributed and personal) it's free to evolve organically. </p>
