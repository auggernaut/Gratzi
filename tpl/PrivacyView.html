         <p>
            Gratzi is different.
         </p>

         <p>
            We don't have fancy legalese for what we can and can't do with your data.
            We won't make money by selling your data to advertisers and "partners."
         </p>

         <p>
            <strong>We can't even access your data.</strong></p>

         <p>Your data is yours. We believe it should stay that way unless YOU say differently.</p>

         <h3>It's privacy by design</h3>

         <p>
            Gratzi is one of the first web applications that inverts the data control model that has
            dominated the internet since the beginning. It does this not with promises or legal frameworks,
            but with the underlying technical architecture.
         </p>

         <p>
            One way to summarize how it works is with the word "unhosted."
         </p>

         <blockquote><p>Also known as "serverless", "client-side", or "static" web apps, unhosted web apps do not send your
            userdata to their server. Either you connect your own server at runtime, or your data stays within the
            browser.</p>   <small><cite title="unhosted.org"><a href="http://unhosted.org">Unhosted.org</a></cite></small>
         </blockquote>

         <p>
            Ok, so what does that mean?
         </p>

         <p>
            People everywhere are beginning to use cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive to store their documents
            and files. These are, in essence, your very own personal servers, or spaces in the "cloud" that you control.
            Gratzi connects with these services (Dropbox for starters) and stores data there.
         </p>

         <p>
            <strong>We don't store gratzi. You do.</strong>
         </p>

         <p>If gratzi.org gets hacked, goes under, or decides to change this policy,
            your gratzi remain safe and unaffected wherever you decided to store them.
         </p>

         <p>Cool, huh?</p>

         <h3>The fine print</h3>

         <p>You can use gratzi without us (gratzi.org) ever touching your data.</p>

         <p>But we realize that some people don't care where the data is, they just want things to work quick and
            easy.</p>

         <p>Because of this, we made it possible to reply to a Grat without connecting your own storage
            service. If you don't connect your Dropbox when replying, we store the data in our Amazon S3 account.
            We will purge data stored there without discrimination periodically.</p>

         <p>Also, if you use email to send gratzi (instead of a facebook message), the email goes first to our server, then to SendGrid.
            We don't store the emails that hit our server, we just pass them along to SendGrid.</p>

         <p>Since gratzi connects to other services, the privacy policies that impact you are:</p>

         <ul>
            <li><a href="http://sendgrid.com/privacy.html">SendGrid</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496">Amazon S3</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy">Dropbox</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">Facebook</a></li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Looking ahead</h3>

         <p>Someday we think everyone will have their very own Personal Cloud server. Data from all the applications
            you use will be stored in this "privacy by design" server that you control.</p>

         <p>Instead of connecting gratzi to the various services above for storage and messaging,
            you connect gratzi to your Personal Cloud. No more Terms of Services you'll have to
            accept in order to use the tools you love.
         </p>

         <p>Then the next era of the internet, with individuals at the center, will
            flourish.</p>
